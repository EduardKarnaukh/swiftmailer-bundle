Swiftmailer Bundle
==================

**This bundle is not maintained anymore as Swiftmailer itself is not maintained since November 2021.**

Please, move to [Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html) at your earliest convenience.
[Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html) is the next evolution of Swiftmailer.
It provides the same features with support for modern PHP code and support for third-party providers.
